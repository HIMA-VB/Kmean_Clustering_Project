# Kmean_Clustering_Project
# California Housing KMeans Clustering and Image Segmentation

This repository contains Python scripts for performing KMeans clustering on the California housing dataset and segmenting images using KMeans clustering. Additionally, it demonstrates the calculation of gradients and the Jacobian matrix for a multivariable function.

## California Housing KMeans Clustering

The script `california_housing_kmeans.py` showcases KMeans clustering on the California housing dataset.

### Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loading the California housing dataset.
   - Handling missing values and scaling the data.

2. **Determining Optimal Clusters:**
   - Utilizing the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Applying KMeans Clustering:**
   - Using KMeans algorithm to cluster the data.

4. **Visualizing Clusters:**
   - Plotting the clusters on a geographical scatter plot.

## Calculating Gradients and Jacobian

The script `calculate_gradients.py` demonstrates the calculation of gradients and the Jacobian matrix for a multivariable function.

## Image Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

The script `image_segmentation.py` performs image segmentation on brain tumor images using KMeans clustering.

### Steps:

1. **Loading Image Data:**
   - Loading specific brain tumor images for segmentation.

2. **Applying KMeans Clustering:**
   - Segmenting the images using KMeans clustering.

3. **Visualizing Results:**
   - Displaying the original and segmented images.
